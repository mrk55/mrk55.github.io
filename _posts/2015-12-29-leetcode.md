### Problem: 322. Coin Change
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 1568
> Total Submissions: 6122
> Difficulty: Medium
 
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)

Example 2:
coins = [2], amount = 3
return -1.

Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


### Problem: 321. Create Maximum Number
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 897
> Total Submissions: 4945
> Difficulty: Hard
 
 Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers.
 Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits
 from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the k digits. You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.

 Example 1:

 nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
 nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
 k = 5
 return [9, 8, 6, 5, 3]

 Example 2:

 nums1 = [6, 7]
 nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
 k = 5
 return [6, 7, 6, 0, 4]

 Example 3:

 nums1 = [3, 9]
 nums2 = [8, 9]
 k = 3
 return [9, 8, 9]


### Problem: 319. Bulb Switcher
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 3674
> Total Submissions: 9981
> Difficulty: Medium
 
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

Example:
Given n = 3. 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

### Problem: 313. Super Ugly Number
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 3670
> Total Submissions: 12596
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

 Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list
 primes of size k. For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32]
 is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes
 = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.

 Note:
 (1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
 (2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
 (3) 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.


### Problem: 312. Burst Balloons
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 2812
> Total Submissions: 9222
> Difficulty: Hard
 
 Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
 number on it represented by array nums.

 You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst
 balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left
 and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right
 then becomes adjacent.

 Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

 Note: 
 (1) You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
 (2) 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

 Example:

 Given [3, 1, 5, 8]

 Return 167

 nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
 coins = 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 167


### Problem: 310. Minimum Height Trees
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 3684
> Total Submissions: 14954
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

 Format
 The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

 
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are
 undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in
 edges.

 Example 1:

 Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

 0
 |
 1
 / \
 2 3

 return [1]

 Example 2:

 Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

 0 1 2
 \ | /
 3
 |
 4
 |
 5

 return [3, 4]

Hint:Show Hint 
 How many MHTs can a graph have at most?

 Note:

 (1) According to the definition
 of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
 exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”

 (2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a
 leaf.


### Problem: 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 4253
> Total Submissions: 12616
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
(ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

 You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

Example:
prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
maxProfit = 3
transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]


### Problem: 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 3716
> Total Submissions: 23552
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

Example:
Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8

Note:

The array is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.

 

### Problem: 306. Additive Number
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 3813
> Total Submissions: 15938
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

For example:
"112358" is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
"199100199" is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

### Problem: 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 11134
> Total Submissions: 34553
> Difficulty: Medium
 
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity? 


### Problem: 299. Bulls and Cows
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 12779
> Total Submissions: 47587
> Difficulty: Easy
 
 You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

For example:
Secret number: "1807"
Friend's guess: "7810"

Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return "1A3B". 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:
Secret number: "1123"
Friend's guess: "0111"

In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and your function should return "1A1B".

You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.


### Problem: 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 7530
> Total Submissions: 30326
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. 

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree
 1
 / \
 2 3
 / \
 4 5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.


### Problem: 295. Find Median from Data Stream
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 7854
> Total Submissions: 39236
> Difficulty: Hard
 
 Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
Examples: 
[2,3,4] , the median is 3
[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

For example:
add(1)
add(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
add(3) 
findMedian() -> 2


### Problem: 292. Nim Game
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 30328
> Total Submissions: 60415
> Difficulty: Easy
 
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

Hint:Show Hint 
 If there are 5 stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to remove the stones such that you will always be the winner? 


### Problem: 290. Word Pattern
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 19481
> Total Submissions: 71462
> Difficulty: Easy
 
 Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Examples:

pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.

Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.


### Problem: 289. Game of Life
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 9517
> Total Submissions: 29341
> Difficulty: Medium
 
According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.

Follow up: 

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this**Question**, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?


### Problem: 287. Find the Duplicate Number
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 15311
> Total Submissions: 42020
> Difficulty: Hard
 
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.


### Problem: 284. Peeking Iterator
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 11542
> Total Submissions: 35886
> Difficulty: Medium
 
 Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3].

Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.

Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.

You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that should return false.

### Problem: 278. First Bad Version
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 24889
> Total Submissions: 117499
> Difficulty: Easy
 
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. 

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

> Total Submissions: 73712
> Difficulty: Medium
 
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

 Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.

Window position Max

### Problem: 218. The Skyline Problem
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 11521
> Total Submissions: 57930
> Difficulty: Hard
 
 A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).

 

 

The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .

The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.

For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

Notes:

 The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].
 The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li. 
 The output list must be sorted by the x position. 
 There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

For example:
2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]

4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is[0,2,1,3].

 Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

 Description:
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

"Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well?
 Show More Hint 
 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off?
 Show More Hint 
 In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition?
 Show More Hint 
 It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3?
 Show More Hint 
 Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.

public int countPrimes(int n) {
 boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n];
 for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
 isPrime[i] = true;
 }
 // Loop's ending condition is i * i < n instead of i < sqrt(n)
 // to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt().
 for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
 if (!isPrime[i]) continue;
 for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
 isPrime[j] = false;
 }
 }
 int count = 0;
 for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
 if (isPrime[i]) count++;
 }
 return count;

### Problem: 202. Happy Number
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 47053

 Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

 .dungeon th, .dungeon td {

 width: 70px;
}

The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess. 
The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. 
Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; 
other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step. 

Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

 
-2 (K) 
-3 
3 
-5 
-10 
1

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:
 1
 / \
 / \
 0 --- 2
 / \

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

### Problem: 87. Scramble String
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**
 
> Total Accepted: 40074
> Total Submissions: 156611
> Difficulty: Hard
 
Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":

 great
 / \
 gr eat
 / \ / \
g r e at
 / \
 a t

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

 rgeat
 / \
 rg eat
 / \ / \
r g e at
 / \
 a t

We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".

 rgtae
 / \
 rg tae
 / \ / \
r g ta e
 / \
 t a

We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".

Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

For example,
words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
L: 16.

Return the formatted lines as:
[
 "This is an",
 "example of text",
 "justification. "

### Problem: 8. String to Integer (atoi)
##### My Submissions
 
**Question**

> Difficulty: Easy
 
 Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: 
It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front. 

Update (2015-02-10):
The signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a const char * argument, please click the reload button to reset your code definition.

spoilers alert... click to show requirements for atoi.

Requirements for atoi:

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.

Example2: x = -123, return -321

click to show spoilers.

Have you thought about this?

Here are some good**Question**s to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Update (2014-11-10):
Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.
